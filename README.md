# Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM)
## Methodology and Application for Time-series Data Analysis 
For my PhD project on "Improving early warning and control of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks caused by  extreme weather in Uganda", as a first objective, I will use the DLNM methodology to study the association
between past extreme weather events and past outbreaks of malaria, Rift Valley fever and yellow fever in Uganda. 

## Open Science
I share the material here for anyone who may need to understand the methodology and its application to time-series data analysis.
