# Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNMs)
## Welcome! 

I will share my way through figuring out this confusing, complicated, and, frankly, cutting-edge modeling and statistics for anyone who may need to understand the methodology and its application to time-series data analysis. 

`Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs)` are a modelling framework used to describe, flexibly and simultaneously, `linear or non-linear delayed effects` between predictors and an outcome, a dependency defined as an `exposure-lag-response association`. These models are mainly used to assess the impact of environmental factors and climate change on health. I will focus on mathematical and statistical concepts that underpin this modelling framework, as well as the `cross-basis` that describes the `bidimensional functions for exposure-response and lag-response spaces` and represents the core of DLNMs.
